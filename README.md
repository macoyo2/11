# Toronto Sports and Recreation
## Overview of the report

This repo contains R scripts and an RMarkdown file used to analyze the city sports and recreation data related to program enrollment, drop-in centre usage and permit activity by seasons (winter, spring, summer and fall) from 2009 to 2015. The original dataset is obtained from the [Sports & Recreation - Program Enrollment, Drop-In Usage and Permit Activity Summary](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/sports-recreation-program-enrollment-drop-in-usage-and-permit-activity-summary/). One of the primary purposes of this report is to analyze the seasonal and annual trends of different types of sports activities' usages in the city. Also, we are focusing on looking at the significant factors that make contributions to the activity participation and propose constructive recommendations for the management. The final report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/macoyo2/Toronto-Sports-and-Recreation/blob/main/outputs/paper/final-paper.pdf)
